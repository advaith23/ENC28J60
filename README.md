# ENC28J60
Functions for ENC28J60 Ethernet Module for Arduino
Includes HTTP GET and POST requests, as well as setting up the module as a server.
It uses the Ethercard library which can be found at https://github.com/jcw/ethercard.
The code is commented to the best of my understanding.
I hope that others working on this module will be aided by this template code :)
